In this project, I use Python to explore data related to bike share systems 
for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
The code imports the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
The script takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
